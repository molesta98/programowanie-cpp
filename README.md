# C++ Programming - Exercises

This repository contains my exercises from a C++ programming course. The exercises are divided into labs, and each lab covers specific topics.

## Repository Structure

* **lab1** - Exercises from the first lab, covering basic language constructs:
    * **instrukcja\_switch** - Exercises from the "Instrukcja switch" module
    * **instrukcje\_warunkowe** - Exercises from the "Instrukcja warunkowa if" module
    * **pierwszy\_program** - Exercises from the "Pierwszy program w C++" module
* **lab2** - Exercises from the second lab, focusing on loops:
    * **petla\_for** - Exercises from the "Pętla for" module
    * **petla\_while\_i\_do\_while** - Exercises from the "Pętla while i do-while" module
* **lab3** - Exercises from the third lab, covering arrays and strings:
    * **tablice\_znakowe\_i\_obiekty\_string** - Exercises from the "Tablice znakowe i obiekty string" module
    * **zmienne\_tablicowe** - Exercises from the "Zmienne tablicowe" module

## How to Use This Repository

1.  Clone the repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the selected exercise directory, e.g.:
    ```bash
    cd lab1/instrukcje_warunkowe
    ```
3.  Open the source files in your favorite code editor.
4.  Compile and run the programs using a C++ compiler.

### Compiling Programs

* **macOS:**
    1.  Make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed. You can install them by running in the terminal:

        ```bash
        xcode-select --install
        ```

    2.  Use the `g++` compiler to compile the program:

        ```bash
        g++ program_name.cpp -o executable_name
        ```

    3.  Run the program:

        ```bash
        ./executable_name
        ```

* **Windows:**
    1.  Install MinGW-w64 (Minimalist GNU for Windows). You can download it from the [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) website.
    2.  Add the MinGW-w64 `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
    3.  Open the command prompt (cmd) and use the `g++` compiler to compile the program:

        ```bash
        g++ program_name.cpp -o executable_name.exe
        ```

    4.  Run the program:

        ```bash
        executable_name.exe
        ```
